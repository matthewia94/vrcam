This is the repository for a vr camera which can rotate along 3 different axis.
The program will have two parts, a mobile application which is designed to run
on the samsung gear vr and a computer portion which will be meant to run ona
raspberry pi and will be used to control the servos on the camera.

The raspberry pi will be using pi-blaster: https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster to generate pwm signals.
